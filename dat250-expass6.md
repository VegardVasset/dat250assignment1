# Technical report

In this project we where supposed to create SPA using the angular framework.
I initialised the angular project using the angular cli ng create command.
I used the todo REST API from the previous assignment todos and created a frontend for it using angular.
Here I display the todos in a list and you can add new todos and delete todos.
I created two components: form and list. 
The form component is responsible for adding new todos and the list component is responsible for displaying the todos.

I did not experience any technical difficulties during this assignment. For future development I would like to add a
update todo function so users could also update the todos not just add and delete them.
