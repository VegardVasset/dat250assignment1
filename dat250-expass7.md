## Experiment 1

The installation process with rabbitmq was very easy and I did not experience any problems. 
I used homebrew to install rabbitmq and then I started the server using brew services start rabbitmq.

## Experiment 2

I did this experiment using gradle with kotlin and added the dependencies for rabbitmq and 
After some trouble because of finding the right dependencies and the right versions I got it to work.
First running send to send the message, then the recv class to see the message being received.

Implemented the two classes NewTask and Worker. 
The code ran with no technical issues

Implemented the classes EmitLog and ReceiveLogs. Worked without any technical issues.
