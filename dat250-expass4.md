## Experiment 1 - Spring project and postman
In this task I ran the Spring applicationn and used Postman to send HTTP requests to the application.
and changed the red green counters to 2 and 3.
this worked without any problems.

## Experiment 2 - REST API
In this task I created a REST API for my todo application. I built out the todo Controller class and created the
TodoService class in order to handle the logic for the todo application by seperating them the controller and 
service layers.

So the todocontroller class is responsible for handling the HTTP requests and the todoservice class is responsible
for handling the logic for the todo application. The todoservice class is injected into the todocontroller class. 

I did not experience any technical problems during this task. And there are no pending issues as of now.
