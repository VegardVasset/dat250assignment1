## Installing MongoDB
Verified the signature using SHA256 checksums and installed MongoDB using brew.

## Experiment 2 (Aggregation)
### Examples tutorial: 
![map-reduce.png](images%2Fmap-reduce.png)

### My own map-reduce operation
Here i Created two new functions mapFunction1 and reduceFunction1. 
The purpose of this map-reduce function is to find the earliest order date for 
each customer. Using this is very helpful for finding out the earliest order 
date for each customer.

## Pending Issues: 
I do not have any current pending issues. The installation process and doing
the tutorials went very smoothly. The only thing I had some trouble with was
using GPG to verify the signature. Therefore I used the SHA256 checksums instead.
